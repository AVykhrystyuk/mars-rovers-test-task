# test-task: MarsRovers

### Assumptions made:
1. Unfortunately users tend to make mistakes, so the app tries to reduce the pain of making them:
    - provides default values which serve as an example of the expected input
    - allows users to make typo several times (3) before the app crashes due to incorrect input
2. The number of rovers deployed should be provided by users, so the app prompts to enter the number.
3. Only one rover can be at the same grid point on the plateau at a time.
4. No rover can go beyond the plateau. 
5. Integration-tests are more useful than unit-tests here as they help to test the whole use case (a user story)


## TASK SPECIFICATION
A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. The navigation team needs a utility for them to simulate rover movements so they can develop a navigation plan.

A rover's position is represented by a combination of an x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be `0, 0, N`, which means the rover is in the bottom left corner and facing `North`.

In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are:
- `'L'` – Make the rover spin 90 degrees left without moving from its current spot
- `'R'` - Make the rover spin 90 degrees right without moving from its current spot
- `'M'` - Move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

Assume that the square directly `North` from `(x, y)` is `(x, y+1)`.

### APPLICATION
Application should be a Console Application written in C#. All input will be entered by the User in real-time. All output should be written directly to the Console window via Standard out.

### INPUT
The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be `0,0`.

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed. Each rover has two lines of input. The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau.

The position is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x
and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation.

Each rover will be finished sequentially, which means that the second rover won't start to move
until the first one has finished moving.

### OUTPUT
The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

#### Example Program Flow:
```bash
Enter Plateau Upper Right Coordinate: 5 5
Rover 1 Starting Position: 1 2 N
Rover 1 Movement Plan: LMLMLMLMM
Rover 1 Output: 1 3 N
Rover 2 Starting Position: 3 3 E
Rover 2 Movement Plan: MMRMMRMRRM
Rover 2 Output: 5 1 E
```
